## Description

This application is built using Handlebars, Express and MySQL. It enables a user to Sign Up with a new account or Login with an existing account to create Posts on the User's Dashboard page. Once a post has been created it is visible to all users via the Home page. Any logged in user can click on a Post on the Home page and leave a comment for that post. 

This application uses sessions so an idle user will be logged out after some time.

Here is a link to the [deployed application](https://rocky-citadel-71699.herokuapp.com/home).

Below are screenshots of the application in use.
